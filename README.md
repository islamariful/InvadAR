# InvadAR
**A first-person shooter Augmented Reality game built on _Unity3D and using C#_**

Note: 
* These are the background scripts for the project, I intentionally left out other files such as assets(Images, audio, other graphics, etc)
so that the user can use assets to their liking and aren't limited by the ones used in this implementation.

* In order to make any changes you will need Unity3D and possibly some other software (Vuforia is what I used).

The code was never tested on iOS so there might be some bugs while running it on an iOS device. If you find any, feel free to email me at s.islamariful@gmail.com.

**Lastly, enjoy!**
