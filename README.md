# InvadAR
A first-person shooter AR game built on Unity3D and using C#

Note: These are the background scripts for the project, I have intentionally left out other files such as assets(Images, audio, other graphics, etc)
so that the user can use assets to their liking and aren't limited by the ones used in this implementation.

The code was never tested on iOS so there might be some bugs while running it on an iOS device. If you find any, feel free to email me at s.islamariful@gmail.com.

Lastly, enjoy!
